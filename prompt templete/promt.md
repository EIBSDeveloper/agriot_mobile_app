I am building a large-scale Flutter application using GetX, HTTP, GetX Localization, and GetStorage .
I already have an HttpService class for making API calls. I want to create a new module in a clean and scalable way.
Requirements:
Use GetX structure: controllers, models, repository, views (UI), bindings, and routes
No custom themes. Use Get.theme.and GetX Localization
Avoid memory leaks, widget re-renders.
Use smooth Render UI & instant feedback.
Follow clean architecture.
I will now give you:
API endpoints
JSON responses
Desired UI/UX flow

I have a Flutter app using GetX + GetStorage + HttpService (Iâ€™ve already created a HttpService with standard get, post, put, multipart, and error handling. Please reuse it for API calls instead of writing new ones.).

Expected Output :
Please generate full module code including:
Controller
Model (matching JSON response)
Repository (using HttpService)
View (screens /widgets)
Bindings
Routes
localization(english)
avoid snackebar use flutter toast
I want to create a new Inventory Module's Fuel

UI/UX Flow:
