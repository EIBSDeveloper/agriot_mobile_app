Context: As the team leader, I need a clear, screen-by-screen breakdown of UI designs for Flutter implementation. Avoid repetition—each screen should be explained independently with precise details.
Instructions: Analyze the provided UI designs and generate a structured guide for Flutter developers. For each screen, include:
Screen Name & Purpose
Briefly describe the screen’s functionality and role in the app flow.
UI Elements & Fields
List all components (e.g., buttons, text fields, images, icons).
Specify static vs. dynamic elements.
Flutter Layout Recommendations
Suggest top-level widgets (e.g., Scaffold, Column, ListView).
Mention key styling (padding, alignment, theming).
Input Types & Controls (if applicable)
Define input methods (e.g., TextFormField, DropdownButton, DatePicker).
Note any constraints (e.g., character limits, date ranges).
User Interactions & Navigation
Describe actions (e.g., button taps, gestures) and where they lead.
Highlight state changes (e.g., loading indicators, success dialogs).
Validation Rules (for forms)
List validation logic (e.g., email format, required fields).
Add error message requirements.
Optional Packages
Recommend useful packages (e.g., flutter_bloc for state management, cached_network_image for images).
Deliverable Format:
Organize by screen (avoid cross-referencing other screens).
Use bullet points for clarity.
Exclude code snippets—focus on conceptual guidance.
