I am building a large-scale Flutter application using GetX, HTTP, GetX Localization, and GetStorage .
I already have an HttpService class for making API calls. I want to create a new module in a clean and scalable way.
Requirements:
Use GetX structure: controllers, models, repository, views (UI), bindings, and routes
No custom themes. Use Get.theme.and GetX Localization
Avoid memory leaks, widget re-renders.
Use smooth Render UI & instant feedback.
Follow clean architecture.
I will now give you:
API endpoints
JSON responses
Desired UI/UX flow

I have a Flutter app using GetX + GetStorage + HttpService (I’ve already created a HttpService with standard get, post, put, multipart, and error handling. Please reuse it for API calls instead of writing new ones.).

Expected Output :
Please generate full module code including:
Controller
Model (matching JSON response)
Repository (using HttpService)
View (screens /widgets)
Bindings
Routes
localization(english)
avoid snackebar use flutter toast
I want to create a new Inventory Module's Fuel

UI/UX Flow:

1. Screen: 06b Sales Details
Purpose
View full details of a submitted sales record including gross/net values, customer, deductions, uploaded documents, and notes
UI Elements & Fields
Static
AppBar with logo, screen title "Sales", and profile icon
Labels: Date, Customer Name, Gross Sales, Deduction, Net Sales, Amount Paid
Section headers: "Uploaded Documents", "Description"
Dynamic
Product name + icon (Tomato)
Date & customer name
Sales figures (Gross, Deduction, Net, Paid)
Uploaded documents (image thumbnails)
Description text
Flutter Layout Recommendations
Scaffold with AppBar
Body: SingleChildScrollView > Column
Use ListTile or Row + Text widgets for labeled data
Documents: GridView or horizontal ListView with thumbnails
Description: Text in padded Container or Card
User Interactions & Navigation
No form inputs
Tap on document thumbnails: open in full screen preview (via showDialog() or route)
Tap pencil/edit icon: navigate to Edit Sales screen
Optional Packages
photo_view: Zoomable image viewer
cached_network_image (if docs are remote)

2. Screen: 06c New Sales
Purpose
Create a new sales record from scratch.
UI Elements & Fields
(Already detailed in previous answer – reused for reference)
Flutter Layout Recommendations
Scaffold > AppBar + SingleChildScrollView
Form sections split using Padding and Column
Deduction section: dynamic list of rows with delete icons
User Interactions & Navigation
Tapping "+" beside deductions opens 06d Add Deduction
Submit button validates and saves form

3. Screen: 06c Sales Edit
Purpose
Edit an existing sales entry with pre-filled values, including uploaded files and deduction items.
UI Elements & Fields
Identical structure to New Sales, but:
All input fields are pre-filled
Action button reads "Update" instead of "Submit"
Uploaded documents are shown as thumbnails with upload option
Flutter Layout Recommendations
Same structure as New Sales
Use conditional rendering to show uploaded files with delete/upload buttons
Consider modular widgets for form reusability
Input Types & Controls
Same as New Sales, with preloaded values into TextEditingControllers or form state
User Interactions & Navigation
Upload button allows file picker
Edit deductions by tapping items
Update button saves changes and navigates back

4. Screen: 06d Deduction (Popup)
Purpose
Add a new deduction with a reason and either percentage or fixed amount.
UI Elements & Fields
Modal/dialog window
Fields:
Reason for Deduction (Text or Dropdown)
Value field
Toggle/input for “in %”
Calculated Deduction Amount (read-only)
"Add Deduction" button
Flutter Layout Recommendations
Use showModalBottomSheet or showDialog for popup
Inside: Column within Padding
Use DropdownButtonFormField for reason if options are fixed
Input Types & Controls
Reason: TextFormField or DropdownButtonFormField
Percentage toggle: Checkbox, ToggleButtons, or segmented control
Amount field: numeric input with validation
Read-only field for calculated amount
User Interactions & Navigation
Toggle between % and ₹ adjusts calculation logic dynamically
Pressing “Add Deduction” adds it to parent form and closes popup
Validation Rules
Reason is required
Value must be ≥ 0
Deduction amount auto-calculated and displayed
